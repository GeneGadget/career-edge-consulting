## Option 1: Simple Setup (Current - Recommended for Now)

Keep it simple:
- **One Calendly event** for the basic package
- Clients book the basic package first
- After completion, you can manually:
  - Send them a separate booking link for add-ons via email
  - Or guide them to contact you to book add-ons

**Pros:**
- Simple, no code changes needed
- Works with your current setup
- You control who books add-ons

**Cons:**
- Requires manual follow-up
- Add-ons aren't directly bookable from the website

---

## Option 2: Advanced Setup (Multiple Event Types on Website)

If you want clients to book add-ons directly from the website:

1. **Set up all 3-4 event types in Calendly** (as described above)
2. **I can update the website** to:
   - Show a service selector
   - Display different Calendly widgets based on selection
   - Link to add-ons from the Services page

**Pros:**
- Clients can book everything online
- More automated
- Better user experience

**Cons:**
- More complex setup
- Requires ensuring clients book basic package first (you may need to manually verify)

---

## Current Implementation

The website currently shows:
- One Calendly widget on the Booking page
- Uses your URL: `https://calendly.com/careeredgeconsulting/`
- This is for the **Basic Package** (2-Page Resume Review)

---

## Recommendations

**For Now (Simple):**
1. ✅ Keep the basic package event type as is
2. ✅ In your Calendly event description, mention:
   - "This is for the basic 2-page resume review ($50 / $30 for students)"
   - "After completing this package, contact us to book add-on services"
3. ✅ After clients complete the basic package, manually send them booking links for add-ons

**Later (Advanced):**
- Once you've set up all event types in Calendly
- Share the event URLs with me
- I can update the website to support multiple booking options
